> My Second project at [42 SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/), where i need to write a bufferd file reader. the problem is to read a line of size N 
> into a buffer of size M without memory leak and data loss.

> This project was made according to [Norm](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/960/norme.en.pdf)

> In the bonus part we need to work with multiple file descriptors at the same time without losing each other's thread.

## Thoughts
   - this project teach you the importance of map all allocated memory and ensure it will be freed when possible.
   - this project teaches the importance of being a friend of gdb
   - This project in general was easy, but the major struggling here was avoid memory leaks (all funcions are tested with [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/))
